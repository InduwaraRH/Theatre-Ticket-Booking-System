Welcome to the Theatre-Ticket-Booking-System, 
a Java application meticulously crafted to streamline the management and supervision of seat reservations for theater sessions. 
Comprising a core program, Theatre.java, alongside supplementary classes Person.java and Ticket.java, this project epitomizes a robust, object-oriented solution.

Notable Features:

Main Program (Theatre.java):

Greets users with a welcoming message upon initiation.
Manages three arrays to track seat statuses (0 for available, 1 for occupied) across three distinct rows with varying seat capacities (12, 16, and 20).
Boasts a user-centric menu presenting eight intuitive options:
Purchase a ticket
Print seating arrangements
Cancel a ticket
Display available seats
Save booking data to a file
Load booking data from a file
Showcase ticket details and total price
Sort tickets by price
Exit the program
Classes and Objects:
Person.java:

Represents an individual, encapsulating attributes like name, surname, and email.
A constructor initializes person objects with the provided attributes.
Ticket.java:

Represents a ticket, incorporating attributes such as row, seat, price, and a corresponding Person object.
Instantiates tickets with specified attributes and furnishes a print method for displaying ticket details.
Ticket Management:

Harnesses the flexibility of ArrayLists for efficient storage and manipulation of Ticket objects.
Facilitates ticket acquisition and cancellation, synchronously updating seat availability.
Offers functionalities to exhibit available seats, persist data to and retrieve data from files, and present comprehensive ticket information.
Additional Functionality:

Computes and presents the aggregate price of all tickets acquired.
Implements ticket sorting predicated on price, furnishing users with organized information.
How to Utilize:

Clone the repository and execute the Theatre.java file.
Navigate through the user-friendly menu to engage with the Ticket-Booking-System effortlessly.
This project embodies a holistic solution tailored to orchestrate and supervise seat reservations effectively, fostering a seamless experience for both theater staff and patrons alike. Delve into the codebase to enrich your comprehension of Java programming through this hands-on application.
